This is a placeholder for your custom logo file.

To use your own logo:

1. Replace this file with your logo image named exactly "logo.png"
2. Recommended format: PNG with transparency
3. Recommended size: 512x512 pixels (square format works best)
4. The logo will be automatically resized to fit the circular container

Supported formats:
- logo.png (primary logo)
- logo_white.png (for dark backgrounds - optional)
- logo_small.png (for small displays - optional)

After adding your logo file, run:
flutter pub get
flutter hot reload

Your custom logo will then appear in:
- Login/Authentication screen
- App header areas
- Any other location using the CalmConnectLogo widget
